This repository contains the code and data for performing Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis on COVID-19 data. 

Our data contains the position of labels for aspects (targets) and opinion words (assessments) along with sentiment polarities for each tweet which were generated as part of this experiment by labeling the data from https://github.com/echen102/COVID-19-TweetIDs 
We provide the tweet IDs, sentimetn scores, and targets and assessments for tweets written by African Americans
